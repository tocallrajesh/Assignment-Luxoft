## NodeJS, Express and MariaDB
- Adding the code to git
- Basic express app and `Hello World`
- Creating the (very simple) database (GUI method)
- Connecting the app to Maria-DB
- **GET** route (loading a user)
- **POST** route (adding a new user)
- **Extra** - Encrypting the password so it's not clear text

Assumptions:
- You have NodeJS and MariaDB installed
- You have a tool like Postman available
- You know some JavaScript and SQL (Mysql/MariaDB)
- You know the basics of running a node app
- You what Git is and what it's used for

_Disclaimer_
This is my first attempt at making a development video for Youtube. I code in real-time and mistakes can (and likely will) happen. I also don't speak English as a first language but I think you'll pick up on that very quickly.
